# Plasma 2350 (W) Demo project

I love the [Plasma boards from Pimorino](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/plasma-2350-w?variant=54829890601339). They are really easy to use, and to work with, for all kinds of LED strip projects. The 2350 exposes some GPIO pins and can be reverse powered at the "tail" an LED strip.

The basic firmware has some demos built in, but they are seperate files that have to be run from REPL/Thonny/VS Code. This project is just a repackage of some of those demos so they can run headless on the 2350 (with an LED strip attached!)

Just press the "A" button (on Plasma 2350) to cycle between demos. It is easy enough to edit to work with 2040 or wire your own button/timer in.
